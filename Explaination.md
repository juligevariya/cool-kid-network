## Problem Statement

The **Cool Kids Network** aims to create an engaging and safe online platform for young creators, explorers, and gamers to connect. The main challenges include allowing users to register and generate characters, providing different levels of access based on user roles, and managing user roles effectively through a user-friendly interface. 

The primary goals are:
- Allow anonymous users to sign up and create a character.
- Enable logged-in users to view their character data.
- Provide role-based access to user data.
- Facilitate role management by administrators.

## Technical Specifications

The application is a single-page WordPress theme that fulfills the following requirements:

1. **User Registration and Character Generation**:
   - Anonymous users can sign up using their email addresses.
   - Upon confirmation, a new account is created, and a random user identity is generated using the `randomuser.me` API.
   - The generated identity includes a first name, last name, country, email address, and a default role of "Cool Kid."

2. **User Login and Character Data Visualization**:
   - Users can log in using their email addresses.
   - Once logged in, they can view their character data, which includes first name, last name, country, email address, and role.

3. **Role-Based Access**:
   - Users with the "Cooler Kid" role can view names and countries of all users, excluding sensitive information.
   - Users with the "Coolest Kid" role have access to view names, countries, emails, and roles of all users.

4. **Role Management**:
   - Admins can change user roles through a protected endpoint that accepts authenticated requests.
   - Role options include "Cool Kid," "Cooler Kid," and "Coolest Kid," and roles can be assigned based on the user's email, first name, and last name.

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **One-Page Application Structure**:
   - The decision to implement a one-page application allows for a seamless user experience, reducing page load times and making navigation intuitive.

2. **WordPress Integration**:
   - Leveraging WordPress for user management and data storage simplifies the authentication and registration process, allowing the focus to remain on user experience and feature development.

3. **Role Management**:
   - The roles are implemented as WordPress user roles, making it easy to manage permissions and access control. This allows the application to benefit from built-in WordPress features for user management.

4. **Use of APIs**:
   - Utilizing the `randomuser.me` API for generating user data streamlines the character creation process, ensuring a variety of identities without manual input.

5. **JavaScript for Frontend Interactivity**:
   - The use of JavaScript (specifically jQuery) enhances the interactivity of forms and modals, providing a better user experience.

## Achieving Admin's Desired Outcomes

The implementation achieves the admin's desired outcomes by addressing each user story as follows:

1. **User Story 1**: Anonymous users can sign up and create a character by providing their email addresses. The application automatically generates a character identity.
   
2. **User Story 2**: Logged-in users can see their character's data displayed upon login, providing a personalized experience.

3. **User Story 3**: Logged-in users with the "Cooler Kid" roles can access the character data of other users, promoting community interaction.

4. **User Story 4**: The "Coolest Kid" role allows users to see sensitive information such as email and role of all users, enabling better community engagement.

5. **User Story 5**: Admins can change user roles through a secure endpoint, ensuring that role assignments can be managed efficiently without compromising security.

## Approach to Problem-Solving

### How I Approach a Problem
- I start by understanding the requirements thoroughly and identifying the core functionalities needed.
- Next, I break down the requirements into smaller, manageable tasks.
- I consider user experience and how to keep the interface intuitive and accessible.

### How I Think About It
- I prioritize features based on user stories and user experience, ensuring that all functionalities are easily accessible from the homepage.
- I evaluate the advantages of developing a theme versus a plugin, considering factors such as ease of deployment, customization, and overall user experience.

### Why I Chose This Direction
- I opted to build a theme rather than a plugin to create a cohesive and tailored user interface for the Cool Kids Network. A theme allows for complete control over the front-end design and layout, which is essential for providing an engaging experience that aligns with the brand's identity.
- By creating a theme, I can integrate all necessary features directly into the site's presentation layer, simplifying user interactions without needing a separate plugin interface.

### Why This Direction is a Better Solution
- Building a theme streamlines the development process, as all the necessary functionalities are centralized within a single structure. This approach minimizes complexity and reduces potential conflicts with other plugins that may alter the site's behavior.
- The theme-centric approach enhances performance and loading speed since there are fewer dependencies and overhead associated with multiple plugins. This is crucial for user engagement, especially in a one-page application context where fast interactions are paramount.
- Overall, by choosing to create a theme, I ensure that the Cool Kids Network delivers a seamless and tailored user experience while maintaining flexibility for future updates and enhancements.
